# Goals

## Last Year Goals

1.  Conduct an assessment project in the Makerspace in partnership with
    the Assessment Librarian Amy Patterson in order to investigate what
    users are doing in the space and if it the space is meeting our
    intial goals.
    -   Done and currently stuck at writing my sections of the paper.
2.  Continue to develop my approach to leadership, specifically, I want
    to focus more on real delegation of meaningful work, making space
    for others to contribute, mentorship, and removing barriers my
    colleagues and the staff I work with face.
    -   Done
3.  Find ways to square the pedagogical model and values of the
    makerspace with the realities of it's growing popularity. As the
    Makerspace gets more popular, we will face pressure to make it less
    interesting in order to make it easier to run. While we will need to
    adapt, as much as possible I want us to stay focused on the purpose
    and values that drive the the Makerspace and be willing to take big
    risks
    -   Done

## This Year's Goals

1.  Enhance the Student Ambassador Program:
    1.  Building on the success of the program, I want to further
        emphasize Ambassadors role as mentors who advocate for our
        values and pedagogies. Part of this will be having mentors be
        more responsible for training each other, as well as more
        responsible for explaining values and pedagogies to users.
2.  Increase Engagement in the Makerspace:
    1.  I want to spend more time in the Makerspace working with
        students and other users, and encouraging people to pursue more
        complex projects. To achieve this goal, I'm planning weekly
        co-working sessions where students, staff, and faculty can
        collaborate on projects, learn new skills, and access resources
        in a supportive environment.
3.  Develop Programming Around "Critical Making":
    1.  I want to start exploring how to encourage users to be more
        critical about the role and impact of technology, design, and
        making. I am not sure yet what this will involve, but it relates
        to my ongoing focus on sustainability, experimentation, and
        fostering a deeper understanding of the cultural and ethical
        implications of making.
