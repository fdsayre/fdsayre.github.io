## Service to the Department

### Program Review Faculty Team (2023 - 2024)

In 2023 - 2024, I was on the Department Program Review Team, the group responsible for planning and overseeing our Program Review. My responsibilities included participating in sessions, developing program learning outcomes, and liaising with CELT faculty and the Office of Quality Assurance. I contributed by writing and editing sections of the self-study report, focusing on areas like access services, the Makerspace, outreach, and communications. Additionally, I engaged with the external review committee multiple times, both in my capacity as a core team member and as department chair. 

### ULDC Chair and Vice-Chair (2023 - 2024)

As the Vice Chair of the University Library Divisional Council (ULDC) from 2023 to 2024 and now the Chair starting in Spring 2024, I have focused on enhancing our council's effectiveness through innovative practices and collaborative initiatives. My main contribution has been the introduction of annotated consent agendas, which provide a structured outline of meeting topics along with additional details and relevant documents while also creating more time for meaningful discussions by reducing housekeeping tasks and putting giving more time to discussion items, with the understanding that decision items always come to ULDC first as a discussion item. 

### ULDC Decolonization and Indigenization Committee Terms of Reference Working Group - Chair (2023)

Additionally, I chaired the working group that developed the terms of reference for our ULDC's Indigenization and Decolonization Committee. This committee is dedicated to addressing Indigenous matters, including systemic challenges, inequities, and discrimination faced by Indigenous students, staff, and faculty. Its mandate includes supporting and honoring the Secwépemc nation, making relevant policy recommendations to the ULDC, raising awareness about Indigenous issues through educational opportunities and events, fostering dialogue about these matters, and supporting Indigenization initiatives across the university.

The committee operates on a consensus decision-making model, promoting collaboration and shared responsibility without stipulating clauses regarding outcomes in the absence of consensus. This approach reinforces our commitment to inclusivity and collective engagement. I also advocated for the inclusion of two CUPE staff positions on the committee, ensuring that diverse perspectives are represented in our discussions.

### EnviroCollab ISP Project (2023-2024)

In 2023 and 2024 I made a number of significant contributions to the EnviroCollab ISP project, which aimed to foster collaborative and interdisciplinary environmental studies programming at TRU. The project kicked off with a day-long retreat in September 2023, where participants brainstormed goals and envisioned the program's potential. Following this, I worked with the ISP leadership and organized and led several events to advance the goals identified by faculty at the retreat.

#### Creativity Breakfast Session

In November 2023 I worked with two colleagues (Cheryl Gladu and Twyla Exner) to develop a breakfast session as a follow-up to the October EnviroCollab retreat. The goal of the session was to prompt creative thinking about what kinds of cross-disciplinary collaborations were possible across various programs, including the humanities and environmental studies. The event emphasized using creativity to address environmental concerns and aimed to prototype interdisciplinary collaborations. 

As part of this session, we created an activity called the Academic Exquisite Corpse Game. Inspired by the surrealist tradition, this was a a collaborative exercise designed to encourage creativity, collaboration, and unexpected outcomes. This encourages fresh, unconventional solutions and embodies the workshop's goal of breaking disciplinary silos, using creativity to engage with complex environmental issues.

#### Field School Mutations: An EnviroCollab Hackathon

In April 2024, I proposed and helped organize and lead a hackathon ("Field School Mutations,") along with two colleagues (Cheryl Gladu and Twyla Exner) which aimed to help participants reimagine whan an extraordinary field school experience could be by encouraging creative thinking and the integration of unique curricular and extracurricular activities. The event, held at the TRU Library MakerSpace, involved collaborative brainstorming sessions to generate innovative ideas for field school experiences, and then had participants packaging those ideas into journey maps describing what their best field school experience might look like from different perspectives. 

The hackathon generated a wealth of innovative ideas and themes for reimagining field school experiences. Under the theme of Movement and Rest, participants proposed activities like sunrise hikes and meditation sessions to balance physical engagement with relaxation. The Eating and Sharing theme inspired ideas such as communal cooking, cultural food sharing, and using food as a medium for storytelling. In Learning and Making Meaning, suggestions included integrating indigenous knowledge, hands-on projects, and interdisciplinary approaches. The Reflect and Create theme encouraged personal reflection through journaling and diverse creative activities. The Journey Maps emphasized the importance of connecting with nature, fostering student autonomy, and acknowledging the emotional journeys students might experience. 

Although there are no immediate plans to implement these ideas, the data provides a valuable resource for future course planning, highlighting the significance of nature immersion, cultural diversity, and community building in educational settings.

### Proposal for Honours College Course (2024 - Unsuccessful)

In early 2024, I collaborated with Dr. Cheryl Gladu from the Bob Gaglardi School of Business and Economics to propose a course titled "Designing for Kw’seltktnéws (Belonging): Creating cultures for life-long learning, resilience, and adaptation in uncertain futures" for the TRU Honours College. This course aimed to explore how educational spaces can be designed to foster belonging, resilience, and adaptability amidst rapid change. Our goal was to engage students in co-designing teams and environments that support lifelong learning and meaningful social change, utilizing active learning and design methodologies. Although the proposal was not accepted, the process was a valuable experience.

### Letter to Senate about the Proposed Elimination of the Visual Arts Program at TRU

In my letter to the Senate of Thompson Rivers University on September 20, 2023, I addressed concerns regarding the application of the BRD 8-4 Program Reductions and Eliminations Policy to the Visual Arts (VISA) program. I highlighted several unresolved issues, including the lack of a clear plan for space and salary savings, conflicting messages about the continuation of VISA classes, and the absence of a transparent process for prioritizing resource allocation. I emphasized the need for a fair and transparent process, noting that the current policy lacks clarity and risks undermining trust in the university's governance. I recommended revising the policy to ensure clear notice and resources for programs facing elimination, along with an independent review to provide reliable data for decision-making. I urged the Senate to extend these considerations to the Visual Arts program and to undertake an immediate review of the BRD 8-4 policy to safeguard the university's integrity and future decision-making processes.

### Board of Governers Election (Unsuccessful) ( 2023)

In the 2023 Board of Governors election I was honoured to be nominated as a faculty representative. I decided to run because of my commitment to collegial representation and transparent decision-making processes as well as a belief in Thompson Rivers University's potential to be a great institution, shaped by our unique history, region, and community. Although I ultimately did not secure a position on the Board, the process reinforced my dedication to contributing to TRU's growth and excellence through advocating for collegial governance.

### TRUFA Treasurer 2023-2024

I served as TRUFA Treasurer from the spring of 2023 until the spring of 2024. During this time I dealt with the normal financial issues of a union, while also addressing significant financial governance issues within the association. A key challenge was the discovery of an unregulated bank account that has been opened by a sub-committee in 2018. This account had been used for TRUFA business but operated outside of TRUFA's established financial processes. In collaboration with the Executive and the President, I facilitated the transfer of this account to TRUFA's control and the undertaking an Agreed Upon Procedure Review of the account by an independent accounting firm to ensure compliance with our financial policies.

I also worked closely with the TRUFA Executive and President to propose several policy and procedural changes aimed at strengthening financial oversight and transparency. These included drafting a new fundraising policy, revising the role of the Treasurer to clarify financial oversight responsibilities, and implementing specific guidelines for opening accounts and managing committee expenses. Additionally, I worked on starting the process of the transition to more modern financial processes, such as acquiring an institutional credit card and drafting policies for its use, with plans to move towards online banking in the future. 

In addition to addressing financial governance issues, I actively participated in Policy Committee meetings to draft new policies that enhance TRUFA's financial oversight and operational transparency. I also collaborated with the TRUFA President on budget planning to ensure the association's financial stability. As part of my regular duties, I managed financial reporting responsibilities, providing updates to the Executive on TRUFA's financial status. Furthermore, I served on a hiring committee alongside the President to select a new executive assistant, contributing to the strengthening of our administrative team.
