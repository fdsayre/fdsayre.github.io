During the last two years my professional development included a successful sabbatical application focused on ecological thinking in makerspaces, a Faculty Excellence Award nomination, and delivering a presentation at a conference on innovative spaces and services. 

## Applied for a Sabbatical (2023 - Successful)

In the summer of 2023 I successfully applied for a sabbatical focused on makerspaces, ecological thinking, and kin-making within the Chthulucene framework. Inspired by Donna Haraway's work, I aim to explore ways of transforming makerspaces into hubs for ecological awareness and multispecies collaboration.

## Nominated for a Faculty Excellence Award (Spring 2024 - Unsuccessful)

This year, the University Librarian nominated me for a Faculty Excellence Award (FEA) for my work in the TRU Library Makerspace. Although I didn't receive the award, I was honoured to be nominated and the considerable work put into creating the application was rewarding in itself.
