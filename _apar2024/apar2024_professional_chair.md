## Librarians' Department Co-Chair

As Co-Chair of the Librarians' Department during the period of July
2022 - June 2024, I have aimed to support my colleagues in the
Department and fulfill the responsibilities of the position as laid out
in the Collective Agreement. Throughout this period, I have focused on
refining our workload distribution, fostering a collegial environment,
and advancing the department's strategic priorities.

-   Chair regular departmental meetings.
-   Met regularly with individual faculty to offer mentorship, support,
    and address concerns.
-   Communicate regularly with my co-chair to discuss and resolve
    issues. We hold bi-weekly meetings to share updates and align
    strategies, which are crucial for the success of our co-chair model.
-   Review Annual Professional Activity Reports (APARs) from Library
    Faculty and write responses. I share this task with my co-chair,
    each of us draft feedback for half of our colleagues and then we
    collaboratively review them for consistency and fairness. I aim to
    provide constructive feedback that acknowledges achievements and
    guides professional development while also contextualizing the
    faculty member's work for future committees.
-   Collaborate with library Library Administration on issues of shared
    concern, including attending bi-weekly Library Leadership Meetings.
-   Participate in the TRU Chairs Group to represent our department.
-   Organized faculty BBQs in fall 2022 and 2023 to foster collegiality
    and community.

### Workload Committee Leadership

Since May 2022, I have chaired the Workload Committee, preparing our
annual workload document and addressing frequent changes and fluctuating
workload demands.

Recognizing these challenges, I led the development of a new format for
workload, which has improved our ability to plan and forecast needs for
the department's future.

Each year I solicit feedback from faculty, led Department-wide
brainstorming sessions to plan for new positions, present the final
draft to the department as a whole to gather additional input and foster
transparency, and write the final version that is voted on by the
committee. Furthermore, I have worked to resolve complex staffing issues
related to faculty secondments, sabbaticals, leaves, and job changes,
ensuring continuity of service and equitable workload distribution. I
have also presented our workload to CUPE Staff Meeting in order to
better foster trust and transparency.

### Proposing a Liaison Teams Structure for Instruction and Consultation Support

A significant achievement during this time was proposing a new "Teams
Approach" for assigning liaison responsibilities. This was driven by the
need to address persistent challenges related to workload distribution,
coverage during leaves or sabbaticals, and the growing complexity of
functional roles within the library. The new model allows for a more
flexible and collaborative structure, ensuring balanced workload and
increased consistency for users. It also provides a built-in structure
for mentorship and collaboration, which is especially valuable for new
or contract librarians.

This new model received unanimous department approval and is being
implemented by my colleagues.

### Development of Cross-Functional Teams

Seeing the success of the Liaison Teams model, I have proposed and
encouraged the development of other cross-functional teams in different
areas in the Department.

-   The Public and Access Services Team was formed to enhance
    coordination of front-line services in 2023 and continues today.
-   A Research Support Team started forming shortly after that, led by
    myself. The team's focus is improving support for research and
    scholarly communication, and includes aligning our services with the
    evolving research landscape at TRU, particularly in response to the
    growth of tripartite faculty. We have also explored opportunities
    for collaborative research projects and redesigning key academic
    spaces, such as the Learning Commons.\
-   In the spring of 2024 two additional teams started coming together:
    a Technical Services Team and a Communications and Outreach Team
    (which I am also part of, and helped initiate).

### Functional Area CUPE Oversight Working Group

In response to what I saw as a gap in support for librarians learning
how to delegate work to technicians, I founded a mentorship group in
Fall 2022 to support faculty librarians in developing leadership skills,
particularly in overseeing the work of CUPE colleagues. This group
created a space for discussing best practices in team leadership, task
delegation, and communication strategies. As part of this initiative, I
have emphasized the importance of improving staff morale and fostering a
collaborative environment. This group has now been paused due to
competiting demands, though I hope the work of the group can be
integrated into the department's processes through discussions at
Department Meetings.
