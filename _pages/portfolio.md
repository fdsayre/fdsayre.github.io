This a public version of my 2022-2024 Annual Professional Activity Report (APAR).

This document represents two years of professional work, including some of the most meaningful work I've done.. This includes building the TRU Library Makerspace into a fully functional learning space and service, becoming co-chair of our department, and serving as the Treasurer of our faculty association.
