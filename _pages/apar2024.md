This a public version of my 2022-2024 Annual Professional Activity Report (APAR). According to the collective agreement, the APAR is meant to be a: 

>formative tool for a Faculty Member to report on their current academic year’s activities, goals and outcomes as they relate to the Faculty Member’s research/ scholarship, teaching professional role, service, and professional development, as well as identify specific goals for the upcoming academic year

Since I received tenure in 2022, I am now only required to submit an APAR every two years. After doing this one, I do not recommend waiting 2 years.

This document represents two years of professional work, including some of the most meaningful work I've done.. This includes building the TRU Library Makerspace into a fully functional learning space and service, becoming co-chair of our department, and serving as the Treasurer of our faculty association. I decided to make this public because I think it is generally a good idea for people who work in academia to be transparent about the work they've done. I also hope that sharing things like this increases the chances of finding future collaborators or helps someone doing similar work. 

The only major changes I made were to remove some documents that had personally idenfiable information and to fix a few small grammatical errors.
