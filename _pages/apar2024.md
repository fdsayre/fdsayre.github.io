This a public version of my 2022-2024 Annual Professional Activity Report (APAR). According to the collective agreement, the APAR is meant to be a: 

>formative tool for a Faculty Member to report on their current academic
year’s activities, goals and outcomes as they relate to the Faculty Member’s research/
scholarship, teaching/professional role, service, and professional development, as well as
identify specific goals for the upcoming academic year

As a tenured faculty member I am only required to do this every two years.
