Hi there,

I'm an academic librarian at Thompson Rivers University where I run the [TRU Library Makerspace](https://makerspace.trubox.ca). I also Co-Chair the Librarians' Department. These days I am particularly interested in creating active learning spaces that foster belonging and encouraging sustainability and ecological thinking.

This site is primarily a way for me to experiment with thinking-in-public.

* Posts are thoughts about a thing or idea.
* Weeknotes are a habit I'm trying to create where each week I quickly share some writing (and links) as a thinking-in-public process without worrying too much about them being fully formed. The idea is that the potential visibility acts as a nudge to develop them a bit more than if they were private, but the lack of an expectation for them to be polished means I actually write them.

I miss when social media was at least useful, but you can find me on bluesky at @franklinsayre.bsky.social and I have a [CV on LinkedIn that is probably out of date](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/franklin-sayre?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) but if you want a response from me [email](https://www.tru.ca/library/about_us/contacts/Franklin_Sayre.html) is probably your best bet.
