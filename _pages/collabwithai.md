# Collaborating with AI Meta Workshop - Outline

> [!NOTE]
> The following is an outline for an experimental workshop on collaborating with AI for faculty, staff, and administrators at Thompson Rivers University.


> I used AI extensively in the creation of this workshop. The original idea was my own, the learning objectives and initial activities were created by me with some feedback from AI from a previous workshop. After that workshop, feedback and issues around a lack of applicable examples led to this workshop as an attempt to use the workshop itself as a common object we would all have expertise on and could work from. After that, AI was primarily used to test the initial prompt, ensure it would consistently produce a similar outline, and test the subsequent activities to ensure they would be stable enough to allow for experimentaiton. At various points I used AI to get feedback, and especially to find potential problems or inconsistencies.

### Introductions

During this workshop we will be learning about generative AI by using it to create parts of the workshop as we go. We will do this by starting with learning objectives and a basic prompt, and then working together (and with AI models) to collaboratively refine and adapt the workshop content, exploring techniques like brainstorming, generating feedback, and transforming content. We will use what we learn during this process to discuss what AI is good and bad at, and how it might fit into our work. 

The example of creating a workshop is not because I necessarily think it is uniquely good at that, but because it should be something we all have experience with being part of as people who work in post secondary education. One of the things I believe is that AI is mostly useful for areas you have experience or expertise with. Also, what we build today will likely not be perfect, or even good, the point is to explore and start exploring the boundaries of AI and how it intersects with our work. 

### Learning Objectives

1. Demonstrate different techniques for prompting GenAI models, including brainstorming and generating content, getting feedback from various perspectives, and transforming content from one format to another.
2. Analyze and explain how different prompting techniques affect AI-generated outputs.
3. Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI models for different types of content and tasks.
4. Critically evaluate the role of expertise in the use of GenAI models, including for prompting and evaluating content.

## Roundtable: What is Your Experience with AI?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ask permission to record audio in first section and explain that this will be turned into text via Whisper and provided to the group to use when exploring techniques for generating feedback and prompting reflection questions later

- Two questions (1 minute per person)
	- Name, department, and what your role is
	- What is your experience with AI
- Facilitator key points:
	- Interesting technology. Numerous ethical concerns. Lots of naive criticism and boosterism. 
	- Students don't know what it is bad at, faculty don't know what it's good at
	- Expertise is key:
		- Exploring AI works best when working within a domain you know well
		- Your expertise and judgment are needed to distinguish what is interesting from what is boring or wrong 
		- Iterate often. Modify prompts. Take what is good and work it back into your original idea.
		- Discover your own use case. 
	- I don't want to use AI to do my work, I want to use AI to do better and more interesting work

## Bootstrapping the Session: Starting Prompt (10 minutes)

This section starts with the group running the starter prompt to bootstrap the session and then working as a group to iterate on the results until we have an outline and some questions that we can use for the rest of the workshop. 

### What We want from This Session

- active learning
- could work with faculty, staff, students
- starts with roundtable where people say who they are and what their experience is
- meets learning objectives
- includes activities for each of the techniques listed in the LOs
- includes discussions at the end for the role of expertise, strengths and weaknesses
- Not in prompt
	- Brief intro section with overview of general rules for collaborating with AI and strategies (not included in initial prompt, so will need to be added later)
	- Number of participants
	- Length of Session

### Starting Prompt

```
I am creating an active learning workshop for university faculty, staff, and students on how to use artificial intelligence, and specifically text generation or GPT models. Attendees might come from across the university, work in teaching, administrative, and/or instructional support roles. Since we can't know ahead of time, the session must start with a roundtable where people introduce themselves and what they do at the university and talk for 1 minute at most about their experience with AI. The learning objectives are: 1. Demonstrate different techniques for prompting GenAI models, including brainstorming and generating content, getting feedback from various perspectives, and transforming content from one format to another. 2.Analyze and explain how different prompting techniques affect AI-generated outputs. 3. Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI models for different types of content and tasks. 4. Critically evaluate the role of expertise in the use of GenAI models, including for prompting and evaluating content. The rest of the session will involve participants using this prompt to build the workshop they are in. It must include activities for each of the techniques in the learning objectives, and discussions of the role of expertise, strengths and limitations for different types of content and tasks. Generate a draft outline of the workshop.
```

### Discuss, Run, Iterate on Prompt as a Group

- How did the prompt do? How close was the result to what we were looking for? 
- What didn't it include that we wanted? What didn't we include in the initial prompt? 
- What did it miss, get wrong, etc?
- Did it do anything that was unexpected?

The initial prompt was purposely missing a few key details, and there are likely a number of other changes we will want to make to the outline. 

At this point you could copy and paste the results and make those changes. You could also use prompts to ask the AI model to make these changes. Often I will copy to output and make some changes, and then give this back to the model with a new prompt. 

For now, lets use prompts to ask the model to make changes. 

#### Iteration Examples

The following are example follow-up prompts. The actual follow-up prompts will depend on what the model generated from the first prompt, which will vary every time. 

A version of this prompt will likely be needed by everyone, since we didn't include the number of people or the length of the session: 

```
a couple changes. the workshop will have 6 participants and will be 1.5 hours. the workshop will involve the group creating the same workshop they are in, thus it will be a meta workshop. the prompt provided will be the same one I just provided. as such, the first activity on brainstorming and generating content will involve discussing, analyzing, and iterating on that prompt. re-draft the outline and questions based on this information
```

This example is more specific to what the model generates: 

```
at the end of section 2, include 10 minutes for me to review general rules and strategies, making the whole section 20 minutes. for section 3, combine exercise 2 and 3 into one activity that covers both. remove section 4 "building the meta workshop since that is what the whole workshop is actually doing. add that time into the reflection questions and getting feedback section`
```

## General Tips for Collaborating with AI (10 minutes)

Before moving on to our active learning sessions, lets talk about some general tips: 

- **Be Specific and Unique**: Avoid clich√©s by providing lots of context
- **Work Within Your Knowledge Areas/Expertise**: Expertise lets you refine your prompts, make judgments, and learn what is actually useful
- **Think Like a Director**: Give AI a role/persona and clear instructions
- **Tell it what you want it to produce:** including output format, audience, tone, language level, etc. 
- **Iterate Often**: Evaluate, Incorporate, Refine through multiple iterations
- **Be Critical**

## Activities: Exploring Techniques (40 minutes)

We are now going to work through a series of activities to explore different prompting techniques. 

We will do this in small groups, as individuals, and together as a large group. 

Remember that the purpose is to explore! Keep the momentum going by taking what is interesting and iterating as much as possible. 

Capture (using stickies, your phone, etc.) anything you notice that is

- Interesting
- Concerning
- Good
- Weird
- Wonderful
- Etc.

So we can discuss it later

### Brainstorming and Drafting Content (small Groups - 10 minutes)

In small groups (facilitator assigns)

#### Group 1: Apply Some Content to the Document

- Apply the UDL Guidelines plaintext file (find file linked under Resources at the top of this file and paste it in with your prompt)

#### Group 2: Generate Discussion Questions Based on the Content for the next Section

- Generate questions for the group discussion activity about learning objectives 2-4 that we can use in that section 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Facilitator captures changes recommended by groups to next sections and notes them in running edits file, uses group AI chat to apply them to next 3 sections

### Use Personas to Elicit Specific Perspectives (small Groups - 10 minutes)

In small groups (facilitator assigns) use personas to generate content from specific perspectives.

Persona examples:

- Use yourself! Write a one paragraph about who you are and what your professional role is and then ask a specific question or for general feedback. Make this rich! Where do they work, what is their focus, what are they known for, etc? This is a place where your expertise helps you explore the boundaries of these models. 
- First year domestic student in a specific program.
- International student whose first language isn't English 
- Librarian with critical perspective on technology who believed education should be for liberation and who doesn't believe AI can be ethically included in any aspect of education. 

Example:

> You are an academic librarian at a small Canadian primarily teaching university who adopts a critical (#critlib) approach to your work, believes education should support liberation, and doesn't believe that AI can ever be ethically included in education. Generate draft questions for learning objectives 2-4 for the discussion section that can guide participants discussion

#### Option 1: Ask for Feedback on the Workshop or Some Aspect of the Workshop

- Adopting a persona, ask for feedback on the workshop as a whole or for a specific part. Use multiple personas and imagine multiple scenarios, e.g. students, faculty from different disciplines, asking for feedback before the workshop, after the workshop, etc. 
- Use follow up questions to probe deeper
- Ask for specific outcomes, e.g. types of feedback, a bullet list, etc. 

#### Option 2: Generate Discussion Questions Based on the Content for the next Section

- Building on the previous section, generate new questions for the group discussion activity by giving the model to adopt a specific persona.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Facilitator prompts participants to capture interesting observations or questions on stickies for 1 minute before we move on

### Transforming Content from One Form to Another (big Group - 10 minutes)

As a group, we use prompts to transform the content we've created from one format to another, e.g. to a draft slideshow, a plain language version, an instructors guide. 

**Option**: We take one question that each person generated during the creating reflection questions section above, and then turn them into a question guide for the group that we use in the next section. 

## Discussion about the Strengths, Limitations, and the Role of Expertise (20 minutes)

As a group, we will work through either the following questions or questions generated earlier by individuals in the group?

Refer to Learning Objectives: 

**Analyze and explain how different prompting techniques/styles affect AI-generated outputs.**

**Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI models for different types of content and tasks.**

- evaluate the strengths and limitations of the AI-generated outputs.

**Discussion: Critically evaluate the role of expertise in use GenAI models, including for prompting and evaluating content.**

- Consider how expertise influences the effectiveness of prompting and evaluating AI-generated content.
- Where was AI useful and where was human expertise crucial.
