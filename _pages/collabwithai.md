### Introduction

This workshop is unique because it is both about creating a workshop and actually creating the workshop at the same time.

This is a meta workshop where you'll actively participate in designing the session as you learn. Starting with learning objectives and a prompt, we will work together to use AI and our expertise to collaboratively refine and adapt the workshop content, exploring techniques like brainstorming, generating feedback, and transforming content. 

### Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate different techniques for prompting GenAI models, including brainstorming and generating content, getting feedback from various perspectives, creating reflection questions, and transforming content from one format to another.
- Analyze and explain how different prompting techniques/styles affect AI-generated outputs.
- Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI models for different types of content and tasks.
- Critically evaluate the role of expertise in use GenAI models, including for prompting and evaluating content.

## Roundtable: What is Your Experience with AI?

- Ask permission to record session audio in first section and start recording (this will be turned into text via Whisper audio-text model and provided to the group to use when they are exploring techniques for generating feedback and prompting reflection questions)
- Two questions
	- Who you are, what your do
	- What is your experience with AI
- 1-2 minutes per person
- I go last, key points:
	- Interesting technology. Lots of ethical concerns. That said, both naive criticism and boosterism in academia is concerning to me. 
	- Students don't know what it is bad at, faculty don't know what it's good at
	- Expertise is key:
		- Exploring AI works best when working within a domain you know well
		- Your expertise and judgment are needed to distinguish what is interesting from what is boring or wrong 
		- Iterate often. Modify prompts. Take what is good and work it back into your original idea.
		- Discover your own use case. 
	- I don't want to use AI to do my work, I want to use AI to do better and more interesting work

## Bootstrapping the Session: Starting Prompt (10 minutes)

This section starts with us running a demo prompt as a group and iterating on it until we hve an outline and some questions that will lead into the rest of the workshop sections. 

### What We want from This Session

- active learning
- could work with faculty, staff, students
- starts with roundtable where people say who they are and what their experience is
- meets learning objectives
- includes activities for each of the techniques listed in the LOs
- includes discussions at the end for the role of expertise, strengths and weaknesses
- Not in prompt
	- Brief intro section with overview of general rules for collaborating with AI and strategies (not included in initial prompt, so will need to be added later)
	- Number of participants
	- Length of Session

### Starting Prompt

`I am creating an active learning workshop for university faculty, staff, and students on how to use artificial intelligence, and specifically text generation or GPT models. Attendees might come from across the university, work in teaching, administrative, and/or instructional support roles. Since we can't know ahead of time, the session must start with a roundtable where people introduce themselves and what they do at the university and talk for 1 minute at most about their experience with AI. The learning objectives are: 1. Demonstrate different techniques for prompting GenAI models, including brainstorming and generating content, getting feedback from various perspectives, creating reflection questions, and transforming content from one format to another.`

`2 Analyze and explain how different prompting techniques/styles affect AI-generated outputs.`

`3 Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI models for different types of content and tasks.`

`4 Critically evaluate the role of expertise in use GenAI models, including for prompting and evaluating content.`

`the rest of the session will involve participants using this prompt to build the workshop they are in. It must include activities for each of the techniques in the learning objectives, and discussions of the role of expertise, strengths and limitations for different types of content and tasks. Generate an outline of the workshop, and key questions I should ask myself before proceeding with creating this workshop`

### Discuss, Run, Iterate on Prompt as a Group

- what does the prompt do
- how close is the result
- what didn't we include? 
- what did it miss 

#### Follow-up Prompt Examples Depending on what the Model Generates

The following are example follow-up prompts. The actual follow-up prompts will depend on what the model generated from the first prompt, which will vary every time. 

`a couple changes. the workshop will have 6 participants and will be 1.5 hours. the workshop will involve the group creating the same workshop they are in, thus it will be a meta workshop. the prompt provided will be the same one I just provided. as such, the first activity on brainstorming and generating content will involve discussing, analyzing, and iterating on that prompt. re-draft the outline and questions based on this information`

A second: 

`at the end of section 2, include 10 minutes for me to review general rules and strategies, making the whole section 20 minutes. for section 3, combine exercise 2 and 3 into one activity that covers both. remove section 4 "building the meta workshop since that is what the whole workshop is actually doing. add that time into the reflection questions and getting feedback section`

## General Rules for Collaborating with AI (10 minutes)

- **Be Specific and Unique**: Avoid clichÃ©s by providing lots of context
- **Work Within Your Knowledge Areas/Expertise**: Expertise lets you refine your prompts, make judgments, and learn what is actually useful
- **Think Like a Director**: Give AI a role/persona and clear instructions
- **Tell it what you want it to produce:** including output format, audience, tone, language level, etc. 
- **Iterate Often**: Evaluate, Incorporate, Refine through multiple iterations
- **Be Critical**

## Activities Exploring Techniques (40 minutes)

We are now going to work through a series of activities to explore different prompting techniques. We will do this as small groups, individuals, and then with the full group. 

Keep in mind we are exploring! Keep the momentum going, taking what is interesting and iterating as much as possible. 

Remember the general rules for prompting AI. 

While we do this, capture (using stickies, your phone, etc.) anything you notice that is: 

- interesting
- concerning
- weird
- wonderful
- etc.

### Brainstorming and Drafting Content (small groups)

In small groups, do one of the following (facilitator assigns)

#### Option 1: Each Group Applies Universal Design for Learning Guidelines and Recommends One Change to the Rest of the Active Learning Sessions

- Apply the UDL Guidelines plaintext file (linked in online resources)

#### Option 2: Each Group Picks a Key Question Generated by the Model and Generates Content in Response

Prompt drafts of content based on the key questions suggested by the model in the initial prompt. 

1. find a question that interests you
2. prompt AI to create content to answer or explore the question, or create content related to the question

#### Option 3: Each Group Generates Questions for the Group Discussion Activity about Strengths and Limitations of AI and the Role of Expertise

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Facilitator captures changes recommended to groups and note them in running edits file, apply them to next 3 sections

### Using Personas to Get Feedback from Different Perspectives (small groups)

In small groups, use prompts to get feedback on the outline (as a whole or for one aspect) from different perspectives by asking the model to adopt a specific persona. 

Persona examples:

- Use yourself! Write a one paragraph about who you are and what your professional role is and then ask a specific question or for general feedback. 
- Use the descriptions people provided at the start of the workshop
- First year domestic student taking 
- International student whose first language isn't English 
- Librarian with critical perspective on technology who believed education should be for liberation and who doesn't believe AI can be ethically included in any aspect of education. 

Example:

> You are an academic librarian at a small canadian primarily teaching university who adopts a critical (#critlib) approach to your work, believes education should support liberation, and doesn't believe that AI can ever be ethically included in education. provide feedback on the current form of this workshop.

Remember to

- Be specific 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Facilitator prompts participants to capture interesting observations or questions on stickies for 1 minute before we move on

### Creating Reflection Questions (individual)

As individuals, prompt reflection questions for the group for the next activity. Questions should pertain to the learning objectives and the content of this workshop. You could ask for relection questions generally or about specific things. 

Exampkes:

> give me several questions to help me reflect on this workshop, from a couple different perspectives that should be important to designing a workshop like this

> give me several questions from a critical perspective that will help me think about how i should be including ethical concerns related to AI into the workshop

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Facilitator captures 1 question from each participant before we move onto the next section. 

### Transforming Content from One Form to Another (big group)

As a group, we use prompts to transform the content we've created from one format to another, e.g. to a draft slideshow, a plain language version, an instructors guide. 

Option: turn the questions from the reflection session into questions for the group, based on the rest of the content. 

## Discussion about the Strengths, Limitations, and the Role of Expertise (20 minutes)

Refer back to Learning Objectives: 

- Analyze and explain how different prompting techniques/styles affect AI-generated outputs.
- Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI models for different types of content and tasks.
- Critically evaluate the role of expertise in use GenAI models, including for prompting and evaluating content.

Discussion: Analyze and explain how different prompting techniques/styles affect AI-generated outputs.

Discussion: Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI models for different types of content and tasks.

- evaluate the strengths and limitations of the AI-generated outputs.

Discussion: Critically evaluate the role of expertise in use GenAI models, including for prompting and evaluating content.

- Consider how expertise influences the effectiveness of prompting and evaluating AI-generated content.
- Where was AI useful and where was human expertise crucial.
