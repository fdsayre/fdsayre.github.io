    "Slime molds can merge with genetically identical colonies to form larger networks.",
    "Scientists at the University of British Columbia have studied how slime molds navigate through changing environments.",
    "The thickness of a slime mold's tubes indicates the efficiency of that pathway - thicker tubes mean more efficient routes.",
    "Slime molds construct networks that are both efficient and resilient, with redundant pathways in case of damage.",
    "When food is plentiful, slime molds spread out; when food is scarce, they consolidate.",
