## Development Notes

- All issues have been resolved:
  1. UI elements now update correctly after each action through multiple mechanisms:
     - Direct UI updates in action handlers
     - Event-based notification system for state changes
     - Fallback interval-based updates as a safety net
  2. Fixed jittery buildings and replaced most urban features with trees/forest
  3. Added consistent time-based animations for smoother rendering
  4. Improved geographic accuracy of the route from Kamloops to Vancouver

## Final Changes Summary

1. **UI Updates Fix**:
   - Added event-based state change notification system in game-state.js
   - Implemented event listeners in ui-manager.js to respond to state changes
   - Retained interval-based update as a failsafe mechanism (reduced frequency)

2. **Renderer Improvements**:
   - Added fixed positions for landscape elements to prevent jittering
   - Used time-based animations instead of random functions
   - Added more tree varieties and increased forest density
   - Improved water animation

3. **Geographic Accuracy**:
   - Updated location data to emphasize forests and grasslands
   - Reduced urban features to better match BC's landscape
   - Improved terrain type classifications

## Final Testing Notes

The game now works correctly with:
- Stats updating immediately when changed
- Smooth, non-jittery animations
- More accurate representation of BC's forested landscape
- Multiple failsafe mechanisms for UI updates

All identified issues have been resolved.
