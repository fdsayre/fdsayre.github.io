> I needed to post some images to test an Obsidian plugin ([GitHub - addozhang/obsidian-image-upload-toolkit: An obsidian plugin for uploading local images embedded in markdown to remote store and export markdown for publishing to static site.](https://github.com/addozhang/obsidian-image-upload-toolkit)) I want to use to make publishing image-rich posts easier, which is also an excuse to share these silly creature bag prototypes I have been playing with...

 The idea is based on a bag my partner bought while we were in Bangkok that looks like a creature, and the fact that she loves creatures of all types. I've been slowly prototyping a bag for her, and these were some sketches and plans I made in procreate, then illustrator, and then paper. 

I am honestly not sure if this will get made, but it was fun to think about.
