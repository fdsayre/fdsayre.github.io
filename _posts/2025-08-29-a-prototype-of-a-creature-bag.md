I needed to test an Obsidian plugin that I'm hoping will make including images in posts here easier by automating how they are named and uploaded to Github pages ([GitHub - addozhang/obsidian-image-upload-toolkit: An obsidian plugin for uploading local images embedded in markdown to remote store and export markdown for publishing to static site.](https://github.com/addozhang/obsidian-image-upload-toolkit)) so I'm using this post as an excuse to share a silly bag prototype..

 The idea comes from a backpack my partner bought while we were in Bangkok that (intentionally?) looks like a creature with a big eye and smiling face. 
 
 Here it is in all it's glory at Expo in Osaka in-front of an AI-powered screen where a creature mirrors your dance moves:

It's a great bag, but not perfect. And since we spent 45 days travelling I've been playing with ideas for bags for both of us as I also work on my sabbatical project. These were some sketches I made in procreate, then illustrator, and then measured out and cut on paper.
