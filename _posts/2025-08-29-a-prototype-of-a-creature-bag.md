> I need to create a post with some images to test an Obsidian plugin that helps upload images to Github pages ([GitHub - addozhang/obsidian-image-upload-toolkit: An obsidian plugin for uploading local images embedded in markdown to remote store and export markdown for publishing to static site.](https://github.com/addozhang/obsidian-image-upload-toolkit)) so I'm using this as an excuse to share these silly creature bag prototypes I have been playing with...

 The idea is based on a bag my partner bought while we were in Bangkok that looks like a creature. Here it is in all it's glory at Expo in Osaka as she dances in-front of an AI-powered screen where creatures mirror your moves:

It's a great bag, but not perfect. And since we spent 45 days travelling I've been playing with ideas for bags for both of us as I also work on my sabbatical project. These were some sketches I made in procreate, then illustrator, and then measured out and cut on paper.
