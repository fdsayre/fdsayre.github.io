>_Weeknotes are where I share what I am doing without worrying too much about them being perfect. They are a way of thinking-in-public. They are written quickly and generally without editing._
## Sabbatical 

- Bullet points are great. So much less threatening than sentences and paragraphs. 

Ethics-application-purgatory
- I am still struggling to get an ethics application finished for the interviews I want to do as part of this project.  
- The semi-structured interview guide has been the hardest thing, because its the fulcrum where all-the-many-ideas-in-my-head about this project is meeting what-are-you-actually-going-to-ask-people-in-language-they-will-understand.
- This is valuable but its frustrating because it is inevitably delaying interviews until the last 2 months of the sabbatical

Are-na and Bagos-Inspo
- Whenever I feel down about where I am with the ethics package, I need to remember that I actually have done a ton of theoretical and conceptual work. 
- Many books and articles read. Most of that is in Obsidian Notes via Zotero and Readwise. 
- But this is a design/creation/making project! It is meant to be visual. There will be physical bags but also digital bags. In the interest of having better ways of finding and organizing these things I started using Are.na to collect images, links, books, pdfs, etc. I really like it! Here are links to a few of my open channels (if you go to my profile you can see more):

Methods bag
- Being stuck in ethics-application-purgatory is only okay because I can start work on the methods bag while I wait for the review to come back. The methods bag brings together all the influences and is meant to be used throughout this project. 
- I need to remember that I don't need to know how everything fits together before starting. The figuring-out will partly being in the doing. 
- I am starting to figure out how to turn an idea into something that can part of a bag without it literally just being a book-in-a-bag.

Materials 
- Starting to figure out ways of representing place through textiles. Cyanotype is going to be one. Shape another. Dying fabrics with natural materials. 
- This week I need to start gathering materials before the first frosts.
